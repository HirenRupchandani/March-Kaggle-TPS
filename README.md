# March-Kaggle-TPS
This repository consists of the notebook that has the insights and predictions for the data used to predict traffic congestion.

The competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-mar-2022).

I have written an entire article series that covers the dataset description, EDA, feature selection and data preparation for model selection, and finally making predictions. You can refer the following list for the articles:
